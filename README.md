# Velomobile Design Project

This repository documents cad designs and notes to try to design high-efficiency human-powered velomobile with a focus on ultra-low aerodynamic drag and sub-30 kg total weight.

So far, I only focused on the aerodynamics part.
For sure, it has not realistic cases, it is just a design in exploration


## Highlights
- Sub-0.10 drag coefficient (Cr)
- 17m/s drag: ~7.3N → ~124W
- Simulation-driven iterative shaping
- 24 simulation logs from Velomobile_01 to Velomobile_22+
- Experimental features: diffuser, cabin ventilation, wake shaping

## Structure

- `/docs` — Design notes
- `/models` — FreeCAD files of each iteration
- `/images` — Simulation screenshots and visual documentation

##  Tools Used

- CAD: FreeCAD 1.0.x
- CFD: InsightCAE OpenFOAM
