# Velomobile Design Project

This repository documents CAD designs and notes for a high-efficiency, human-powered velomobile. The focus is on achieving ultra-low aerodynamic drag and a total weight under 30 kg.

Currently, the work is primarily centered around aerodynamic optimization. These designs are conceptual and experimental — not yet constrained by real-world manufacturing or regulatory limitations.

## Highlights

- Target drag coefficient (Cr): **< 0.10**
- Drag at 17 m/s: **~7.3 N** → Power: **~124 W**
- Fully simulation-driven, iterative shape refinement
- 20+ design iterations (Velomobile_01 → Velomobile_22+)
- Experimental aerodynamic features:
  - Diffuser integration
  - Tail shaping for wake control
  - Cabin ventilation via pressure differential [TODO]
